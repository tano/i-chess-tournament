We have to implement helper functions for chess tournament organizers.

You have to implement 3 functions (details are located in chess.test.js):
  * splitIntoGroups:    splits participants into groups
  * createBattles:      creates battles for groups
  * arrangeTournament:  composes two functions mentioned above

```shell
    yarn install
    yarn test
```
